## Iteration 1
 * Start date: Thursday, January 25
 * End date: Thursday, February 8

## Process
At first, we all meet and introduce ourselves, and started discussing about ideas and exchange information of our strengths and skills. We used a document to aggregate all of our potential ideas(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c-T9WLUOcBiW209DZqWVstQTQSgSZQ7ziPYMJ5-Owgo/edit?usp=sharing).Then, we came up with a common idea we all agree with, and find the solution together. We then split into sub teams and assign each teams with a particular task. We plan to meet again (preferably at least once every week) and review the work we have done so far.

#### Roles & responsibilities
Currently, everyone in the team has the same roles and responsibilities (brainstorm ideas, talk about how we can make our project possible). However, we will distribute different responsibility to each one of us based on member’s interest and skill-set, some of these roles could be product manager, developers, editors, reviewers, and more.

#### Events
We are planning to have in-person meeting every Thursdays, wherever there is a room available, most likely will be in one of the Bahen’s lab. The in-person meeting will have different purposes each time, some of the examples are coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync, etc. We also have a group chat on Slack to communicate on regular basis. We plan to have a group call if we run into problems and not everyone is available to meet.

#### Artifacts - Planning
After every meeting, to-do list will be created, each tasks will be numbered with a priority number with 1 being the most important, and we’ll do the task with the most priority first (haha just like popping the priority queue). The priority number will be based on workload and deadline date. The closer the deadline, the higher the priority. Each task will be assign to team members by discussing as a group who is more comfortable with doing what, then we will assign the task that go in hand with the team members’ strengths.
