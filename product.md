#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a website in order to help people at University of Toronto get information and interact with accessibility services by bringing information from various sources into one platform. Currently, online accessibility services for the university are on different websites such as one general one on Student Life (https://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as), one for accommodations for tests and exams (http://www.ace.utoronto.ca/tes/register.html), and one with the map of accessibility locations on campus (http://map.utoronto.ca/). Many students at the university use accessibility in one or more forms in terms of physical accessibility and mental accessibility, for example wheelchairs accessible building locations and needing notes respectively. Our plan is to integrate all this information into one website with all the information including locations, note-taking, letters of accommodation, among other things. We plan to make the website personalized for each user, as each person has their own types of accessibility needs. We are going to use visual graphs to sort information and make it easy for users to get what they need based on what they put as relevant (such as note-taking).  Some features of the website will include a way to facilitate ways to register for extra time when writing tests or exams, sending professors letters of accommodation and illness notes electronically, signing up to be a note-taker and uploading notes online instead of going to the office on Spadina, and sending email announcements regarding any changes or announcements to the accessibility program at the university. If we have time, a bonus feature would be a calendar of a student. Overall, we want to make sure accessibility services are all put together in a single website to facilitate and personalize the process of receiving accessibility services at University of Toronto.

Something to do with accessibility at uoft
Currently accessibility services are all in different platforms/everywhere instead of just one place
One of our goals is to make it personalized
Displayed in graphical structure to sort information and to make it easy for users to find what they need based on their interested category etc etc
We will build a website (like a web portal of sorts where you can log in and have settings and register for counselors, appointments etc.)
Part of our product can include:
Letter of accommodation -> you have to send it to profs (currently is only available to download if you use firefox)
Facilitate ways to register for midterms and finals for extra time
A student needs a notetaker so the prof needs to send out an email to the rest of the class to ask for a volunteer note taker
(our app can enable the student to send the email directly and the prof can also email through this app instead of going through several)
Sometime accessibility services make announcement on their website and students are unaware of these announcements (so maybe email registered students these announcements too?)
Calendar of schedule (as a bonus)
Link andrei thing and show how links with the accessibility websites now for uoft suck

#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our target users are students at U of T St George campus with physical, mental and other accessibility needs. The accessibility accommodations might be temporary like in case of illness or long term. Below are 3 user cases of the target population.

Case 1: Student who needs physical accessibility resources (temporary)

Persona:

Jenny is a second year U of T student. She suffered a concussion and so she needed accessibility accommodation to be able to continue being in school while recovering. She faced a great difficulty finding information about how to get those accommodations because it was too scattered on different websites and unspecific to her condition. In addition, most of the information was telling her that she is too late to be assisted. Due to the strain of trying to find information, she fell behind on her school work and her to drop most of her courses.

User stories

As a student with temporary physical accessibility need, I want to get information about the assistance I need like getting extensions for my assignments and exams and where I can get it so that I can continue doing well in my classes

As a student with temporary physical accessibility need, I want to get the information in one place, so that I won’t spend more time than necessary to gather all that information.

Case 2: Student who need academic accommodations

Persona:

John is a first year U of T student with generalized and social anxiety. This means that he is unable to take notes in class, and it affects his ability to write exams within the given time. John wants to do well in class but he is unable to take notes in class, and he needs more time during his exams and extensions for all his assignments. However, he is unaware of what kind of accommodation he can get for his condition as different classes have different stipulations for accessibility needs. In addition, he needs to fill in some documents like letter of accommodations but they are scattered on different websites, so it is so hard to get all the information about his accommodations in one place.

User stories:

As a student who needs academic accommodation, I want to know the requirements to get necessarily accommodations in my classes without going through the prof, so that I can get them as soon as possible and do well in my classes

As a student who needs academic accommodation, I want an accessible and easier way to submit the necessary documents (like the letter of accommodation) so that I can get the necessary accommodations faster

Case 3: Student with physical mobility needs

Persona:

Jane is a U of T student who has been in a wheelchair since she was a kid. Ever since she came to U of T, she has always to attend events because when she arrived at a building that it was inaccessible to her. After many occasions of going to events or classes and finding out they are inaccessible, she stopped leaving the house and started to depend on note takers and online lectures to make it through the semester. In an attempt to try and help her situation she tried to google the building locations to ensure they were accessible. However, the information was either inaccurate or not there.

User stories:

As a student with physical mobility needs, I want to know where accessibility entrances for buildings in U of T are so that I can get to my destination faster and without any trouble

As a student with physical mobility needs, I want to access and submit necessary forms necessary to get accommodation so that I won’t have to go to the accessibility services office in person

As a student who is gender neutral, I want to know building in U of T with gender neutral bathrooms so that I feel safe and comfortable at school.



Students and Staff on the University of Toronto St.George Campus
With physical and mental accessibility needs (most students who are registered with accessibility services)
But is not isolated to this target population as anyone can use it (that’s the point of accessibility duh)
Make it specific to type of user (ie. students with different accessibility needs)

Case 1: Student who needs physical accessibility resources
Student suffered concussion, faced difficulty finding information about how to get assistance, such as extension on assignments and tests, note taking, exam booking and counselor, due to scatteredness of information, unable to demonstrate academic potential
Solution:

Case 2: Student with other accessibility needs
Student needs extra time during exams and midterms so they need to request and send a letter of accommodation and schedule a separate time to write them
Solution:



Case 3: Student with physical mobility needs
Student needs to know where accessibility entrances are around UofT where accessible washrooms are where gender neutral washrooms are
When registered with accessibility, students usually needs to bring the forms to the office (which is on spadina and college), but if such student is physically injured, for example, broke his/her leg, then student may be unable to go hand in the registration form.
Solution:

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?


Our product organizes accessibility resources in one convenient system as opposed to the various different websites or platforms that students currently use for accessibility needs. For example, to get extra time to write an exam students need to get a letter of accommodation along with a note from an accessibility counselor then submit it to the accessibility services website. With our product, users are able to upload, compile, and keep track of required documents all in one place thus reducing the stress involved in submitting a request. This is especially useful if the same documents are required to request for extra time for a midterm, which are emailed to profs and not accessibility services. Students do not need to go to different platforms anymore, they can use our product to email profs and to submit to accessibility services. As a user who is experiencing either physical or mental distress which prompts accessibility needs, simplifying a task such as this is a key component in a good user experience. Additionally, users are able to personalize what information is shown to them based on their accessibility needs. Instead of a one size fits all approach that many services use today, our products goal is to give the user control over what information and data they see as it relates to their accessibility needs. This reduces the clutter, ensures the information is relevant and accurate for their situation, and also saves them a significant amount of time because they don't need to search through all the different resources. When using our product users would simply find everything they need within 3-4 clicks and it would only take a few minutes. In essence, users should choose our product because it allows them to navigate UofT systems in a simple and condensed format, find resources easier, and perform tasks quicker.

Users would choose it because it would allow them to send everything electronically vs having to go to several places and submit the required documents
Users would choose our product because the process of accessing accessibility resources is difficult and a stressful experience for users that are already in physical and mental distress (???? Lmao idk) because all these resources are scattered and located in different places on different websites. Our product will have all this information in one place so that users can access everything they need easily.
The way that all these resources are being displayed today are all over the place, for example:
To find ____, you have to go here:
But to find ___, you have to go here:
 Using our product would save users a significant amount of time. A task where users have to find how to request an extension for assignments, a user would have to go through 3-4 resources taking about an hour (seems excessive?) for the user to do the research to find these resources. When using our product, users would simply find everything they need within 3-4 clicks only taking a few minutes.
This also allows users to discover new information because with all the resources being scattered in different websites, often times, users would not be able to find it as it’s disorganized and time consuming which results them in giving up on their search??
Nature of our app is to provide data and to inform the users. Useful because it allows users to navigate around UofT and to find resources easier and is what our target audience is looking for when performing these tasks.
