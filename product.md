# Student Accessibility Portal (SAP)

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?



We are planning to build a website in order to help people at University of Toronto get information and interact with accessibility services by bringing information from various sources into one platform. Currently, online accessibility services for the university are on different websites such as one general one on [Student Life](https://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as), one for [accommodations for tests and exams](http://www.ace.utoronto.ca/tes/register.html), and one with [the map of accessibility locations on campus](http://map.utoronto.ca/). Many students at the university use accessibility in one or more forms in terms of physical accessibility and mental accessibility, for example wheelchairs accessible building locations and needing notes respectively. Our plan is to integrate all this information into one website with all the information including locations, note-taking, letters of accommodation, among other things. We plan to make the website personalized for each user, as each person has their own types of accessibility needs. We are going to use visual graphs to sort information and make it easy for users to get what they need based on what they put as relevant (such as note-taking).  Some features of the website will include a way to facilitate ways to register for extra time when writing tests or exams, sending professors letters of accommodation and illness notes electronically, signing up to be a note-taker and uploading notes online instead of going to the office on Spadina, and sending email announcements regarding any changes or announcements to the accessibility program at the university. If we have time, a bonus feature would be a calendar of a student. Overall, we want to make sure accessibility services are all put together in a single website to facilitate and personalize the process of receiving accessibility services at University of Toronto.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our target users are students at U of T St George campus with physical, mental and other accessibility needs. The accessibility accommodations might be temporary like in case of illness or long term. Below are 3 user cases of the target population.

Case 1: Student who needs physical accessibility resources (temporary)

Persona:

Jenny is a second year U of T student. She suffered a concussion and so she needed accessibility accommodation to be able to continue being in school while recovering. She faced a great difficulty finding information about how to get those accommodations because it was too scattered on different websites and unspecific to her condition. In addition, most of the information was telling her that she is too late to be assisted. Due to the strain of trying to find information, she fell behind on her school work and her to drop most of her courses.

John wants to do well in class but he is unable to take notes in class, and he needs more time during his exams and extensions for all his assignments. However, he is unaware of what kind of accommodation he can get for his condition as different classes have different stipulations for accessibility needs. In addition, he needs to fill in some documents like letter of accommodations but they are scattered on different websites, so it is so hard to get all the information about his accommodations in one place.

Ever since she came to U of T, she has always to attend events because when she arrived at a building that it was inaccessible to her. After many occasions of going to events or classes and finding out they are inaccessible, she stopped leaving the house and started to depend on note takers and online lectures to make it through the semester. In an attempt to try and help her situation she tried to google the building locations to ensure they were accessible. However, the information was either inaccurate or not there.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?


Our product organizes accessibility resources in one convenient system as opposed to the various different websites or platforms that students currently use for accessibility needs. For example, to get extra time to write an exam students need to get a letter of accommodation along with a note from an accessibility counselor then submit it to the accessibility services website. With our product, users are able to upload, compile, and keep track of required documents all in one place thus reducing the stress involved in submitting a request. This is especially useful if the same documents are required to request for extra time for a midterm, which are emailed to profs and not accessibility services. Students do not need to go to different platforms anymore, they can use our product to email profs and to submit to accessibility services. As a user who is experiencing either physical or mental distress which prompts accessibility needs, simplifying a task such as this is a key component in a good user experience. Additionally, users are able to personalize what information is shown to them based on their accessibility needs. Instead of a one size fits all approach that many services use today, our products goal is to give the user control over what information and data they see as it relates to their accessibility needs. This reduces the clutter, ensures the information is relevant and accurate for their situation, and also saves them a significant amount of time because they don't need to search through all the different resources. When using our product users would simply find everything they need within 3-4 clicks and it would only take a few minutes. In essence, users should choose our product because it allows them to navigate UofT systems in a simple and condensed format, find resources easier, and perform tasks quicker.
